                <h3> How to teach: Past Simple</h3>
                <h5>The Past Simple tense is a fundamental aspect of the English language, allowing us to express actions, events, or states that occurred and were completed in the past. It's a crucial tool for storytelling and conveying historical information. This tense is particularly useful when discussing events without any connection to the present.<br>
                  <br>
    Regular verbs follow a straightforward pattern when conjugated in the Past Simple. The suffix "-ed" is added to the base form of the verb, regardless of the subject. For instance, "talk" becomes "talked," and "play" becomes "played." On the other hand, irregular verbs don't adhere to a consistent pattern. They undergo unique changes in their base forms when converted to the Past Simple. For example, "go" changes to "went," and "eat" changes to "ate." <br>
                  <br>
    In spoken and written English, the Past Simple finds application in various scenarios. It is employed in recounting personal experiences, narrating historical events, and discussing actions that happened at specific times in the past. This tense helps create a clear timeline of events and is essential for effective communication. Understanding the differences between regular and irregular verbs in the Past Simple tense is key to constructing accurate and coherent narratives in English.<br></h5>

                   <h3>Business English</h3>
                   <h5>Teaching Business English offers a comprehensive approach to equipping individuals with the linguistic tools necessary for success in the corporate world. This specialized branch of English language instruction covers a wide range of topics, enabling learners to communicate confidently in diverse business contexts. <br>
                    <br>
                    From discussing finances, savings, and investments to delving into real estate and dissecting large business models, Business English classes provide a platform for learners to engage with essential concepts. Vocabulary related to financial transactions, market analysis, and economic trends forms the backbone of these lessons. Students not only learn how to interpret financial reports but also acquire the ability to articulate their insights effectively. <br>
                    <br>
                    Real estate discussions and negotiations are another integral part of Business English training. Learners delve into property descriptions, market trends, and rental agreements, fostering their ability to communicate clearly with clients, partners, and investors. Large business models, including concepts like mergers, acquisitions, and strategic planning, are also explored, enhancing students' proficiency in conveying complex ideas succinctly.<br>
